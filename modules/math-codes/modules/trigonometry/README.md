## Rays and Angles

Before learning about **Angles**, we need to understand **Rays**.

> A **"Ray"** is a directed line segment.

For example, see the **Ray** below:

![img](images/ray-01.jpeg)

See that a ***"Ray"*** has:

 - **An "Endpoint":** The first point is called the *"endpoint"* of the *"Ray"*
   - The starting point of the ray.
 - **A "Direction":** We can also define the direction of the *"Ray"*
   - We define a arrow under the endpoint and the final point: $\overrightarrow{EF}$
   - **NOTE:** See that is similar to a Vector.

<!---
\overrightarrow{EF}

> An **"Angle"** is the **"union of two rays"** having a *common endpoint*.

For example, see the **"Angle"** below:

![img](images/rays-angles-01.jpeg)  

See that:

 - **We have an endpoint "E":**
   - Common to rays **"D"** and **"F"**.
 - **Two rays "D" and "F" have a common endpoint "E".**
 - **The endpoint "E" is called the "vertex" of the angle:**
   - And the two rays are the sides of the angle.
 - **The angle to our image is formed:**
   - From $\overrightarrow{ED}$ and $\overrightarrow{EF}$

## Angles and Greek Letters

> **Greek letters** are often (frequentemente) used as variables for the measure of an angle.

For example, see the common Greek letters used to measure angles:

| Œ∏     | œÜ or œï | Œ±     | Œ≤    | Œ≥     |
|-------|--------|-------|------|-------|
| Theta | Phi    | Alpha | Beta | Gamma |

<div id="angle-initial-terminal-sides"></div>

## Angle: Initial and Terminal sides

Angle creation is a **dynamic process**... We start with two rays lying on top of one another.

 - **We leave one fixed in place:**
   - The fixed ray is the *"initial side"*
 - **And rotate the other:**
   - The rotated ray is the *"terminal side"*.

In order to identify the different sides, we indicate the rotation with a small arrow close to the vertex as the image below:

![img](images/angle-01.jpeg)

<div id="measure-of-angles"></div>

## Measure of Angles

> The **measure of an angle** is the **amount of rotation from the initial side to the terminal side**.

Probably the most familiar unit of angle measurement is the **"degree"**.

 - One **degree** is $\frac{1}{360}$ of a circular rotation.
 - So a complete circular rotation contains **360 degrees**.

> **NOTE:**  
> An angle measured in degrees should always include the unit ‚Äúdegrees‚Äù after the number, or include the degree symbol `¬∞`.

For example:

```bash
90 degrees = 90¬∞
```

 - If the angle is measured in a **"counterclockwise direction"** from the initial side to the terminal side, the angle is said to be a **"positive angle"**.
 - If the angle is measured in a **"clockwise direction"**, the angle is said to be a **"negative angle"**.

For example, see the images below to understand more easily:

![img](images/angle-02.png)  

To place the terminal side of the angle, we must calculate the fraction of a full rotation the angle represents. We do that by dividing the angle measure in degrees by **"360¬∞"**.

For example:

 - To draw a **"90¬∞"** angle, we calculate that $\frac{90}{360} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25$.
   - So, the terminal side will be *one-fourth* of the way around the circle, moving counterclockwise from the positive x-axis.
 - To draw a **"360¬∞"** angle, we calculate that $\frac{360}{360} = 1$.

See the image below to understand more easily:

<div id="circle-measurement"></div>

## Measurement of a Circle

To measure a **Circle** we have four important concepts:

![img](images/circle-01.png)  

 - **Center of the circle:**
   - The center is the fixed point inside the circle that is the same distance away from all points on the circle's edge (circumference). 
 - **Circumference:**
   - The circumference is the total length around (bounded) the edge of the circle.
 - **Radius:**
   - The radius is any line segment that connects the center of the circle to a point on the edge (circumference). All **radii (radii = plural of radius, it's the plural form of radius, indicating there are more than one of these lines)** of a circle have the same length.
 - **Diameter:**
   - The diameter is a straight line that passes through the center of the circle and touches opposite ends of the circle's edge. **Its length is equal to twice the radius**.

<div id="phi-calc"></div>

## Pi (œÄ) = Circumference/Diameter

> Independently, the length of the *"circumference"* or *"diameter"* of a circle, **if we divide the circumference by the diameter the result is always Pi (œÄ)**.

![img](images/pi-gif-01.gif)  

> **NOTE:**  
> This is interesting to know because we will always have a *constant (pi œÄ)* that can be used to discover other values from it.

---

<div id="circumference-calc"></div>

## Circumference = Pi (œÄ) x Diameter

To find the circumference of a circle, we need to know the **"Pi (œÄ)"** and the **"Diameter"**.

The formula is:

![img](images/circumference-calc-01.png)  

> **For example, imagine you walk around a circle which has a diameter of 100 m, how far have you walked?**

![img](images/circumference-calc-02.png)  

---

<div id="diameter-calc"></div>

## Diameter = Circumference / Pi (œÄ)

To find the diameter of a circle is very simple. For example, see the formula below:

![img](images/diamter-calc-01.png)  

> **For example, imagine you measured 94 mm around the *outside of a pipe (parte externa de um tubo)*... what is its diameter?**

![img](images/diamter-calc-02.png)  

---

<div id="radius-calc"></div>

## Radius = Diameter / 2

> A **Radius** is **half of the diameter**.

![img](images/radius-01.png)  

> **NOTE:**  
> Knowing that we can say that the *"radius"* is the *"diameter divided by two"*.

A Circle can have an uncountable number of Radius. For example:

![img](images/radius-03.png)

Looking at the first Circle, we see that we have many Radii with different spaces between them, but they all have the same length.

<div id="radian"></div>

## Radian = Arc that has the same length as the radius

> A **Radian** is an Arc that has the same length as the radius.

![img](images/radian-gif-01.gif)

---

<div id="area-calc"></div>

## Area = œÄ x r^2

> The area of a shape refers to how much space it occupies.

 - When **"estimating"** the **area of a circle** we use the formula: `A = 3r¬≤`.
   - Where `r` is the radius.
 - When **"calculating"** the **area of a circle** we use the formula: `A = œÄr¬≤`.
   - Where `r` is the radius.

<div id="Unit-Circle"></div>

## Unit Circle

 - A **"Unit Circle"** is a circle *"on the Cartesian Plane"* that *"has a radius of 1 unit"*.
 - And is *centered* at the *origin (0, 0)*.

![img](images/unit-circle-01.png)  

See that our circle:

 - Has a *"radius of 1"*.
 - Is centered at the *"origin (0, 0)"*.

## Sine

The ***Sine /sa…™n/* formula** is:

![img](images/sine-01.png)  

For example, given the triangle below:

![img](images/sine-02.png)  

Find the value of **sin t**:

 - The side **opposite** to the angle **t** is **7**.
 - And the **hypotenuse** of the triangle is **15**.
 - Then, **sin(t) = 7/25**.

> **Ok, but why the Sine formula is (Opposite/Hypotenuse)?**

<div id="intro-to-cosine"></div>

## Cosine

The **Cosine /Ààko ä.sa…™n/ formula** is:

![img](images/cosine-01.png)  

<div id="tangent"></div>

For example, given the triangle below:

![img](images/cosine-02.png)  

Find the value of **cos Œ±**:

 - The side **adjacent** to the angle is **15**.
 - And the **hypotenuse** of the triangle is **17**.
 - Then, **cos(Œ±) = 15/17**.

> **Ok, but why the Tangent formula is (Adjacent/Adjacent)?**

> ***Trigonometry*** (from Greek **trigonon "triangle"** + **metron "measure"**.

 - The most interest triangle in the Trigonometry is the *Right-Angled Triangle*.
 - The **right angle** is shown by the little box in the corner (canto):

For example, see the **Right-Angled Triangle** below:

![img](images/trigonometry-01.png)  

 - **The angle is often labeled (frequentemente rotulado) *"Œ∏"*, and the three sides are then called:**
   - **Opposite:** opposite to the angle **Œ∏**.
   - **Adjacent:** adjacent (next to) the angle **Œ∏**.
   - **Hypotenuse:** The longest side is the *Hypotenuse*.
