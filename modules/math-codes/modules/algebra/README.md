## Operator Precedence AKA Order of Operations

There are situations in algebra when more than one operator is used in an expression. We must now determine which operation to do first.

 - Anything in `parentheses ()` and `brackets {}` is calculated first, regardless of the operator inside.
 - *Exponents* and *square roots* are calculated second.
 - Third, *Multiplications* and *divisions*
 - Finally, we have the addition and subtraction.

For example, imagine we have the following expression:

$8 \div 2 (2 + 2)$

First, we need to solve the `parentheses ()`:

$8 \div 2 \cdot 4$

> **The division and multiplication have the same order of operations. How to solve that?**

**NOTE:**  
If the algebraic expression contains the same order of priority, the expression will be evaluated from **left to right (left➔right)**:

For example:

$8 \div 2 \cdot 4$  
$4 \cdot 4 = 16$

## Percents

> When we say **"Percent"** we are really saying **"per 100"**.

For example, one percent (1%) means 1 per 100:

![img](images/1-per-100.png)  

To understand more easily, let's take a look at the examples below:

**50% means 50 per 100:**
![img](images/50-per-100.png)  

**25% means 25 per 100:**
![img](images/25-per-100.png)

Because **"Percent"** means **"per 100"** think:

> **"this should be divided by 100"**

**NOTE:**  
So, **75%** really means $\frac{75}{100}$.

## Percentages calculus are Symmetry (or Bidirectional)

This little rule can make some percentage calculations easier:

**x% of y = y% of x**

For example:

 - **8% of 50** is the same as **50% of 8**:
   - And **50%** of **8** is **4**.
 - So, **8% of 50** is also **4**.

## Percent vs Percentage

In the Dictionary says:

 - *"Percentage"* is the *"result obtained by multiplying a quantity by a percent"*.
 - So 10 percent of 50 apples is 5 apples:
   - The 5 apples is the percentage.

**NOTE:**  
But in practice people use both words the same way.

## Apples percentage question

Imagine we have 200 apples...

> ***15%* of *200* apples are bad. How many apples are bad?**

$15\% = \frac{15}{100}$  
$= \ \frac{15}{100} \times 200 = 15 \times \frac{200}{100}$  
$= 15 \times 2$  
$= 30$  

**NOTE:**  
So, 30 apples are bad.

> **Now imagine if only *10* of the *200* apples are bad, what percent is that?**

$As \ a \ fraction, \frac{10}{200} = 0.05$  
$As \ a \ percentage \ it \ is: \frac{10}{200} \times 100 = 5\%$  

**NOTE:**  
So, **"5%"** of those apples are bad.

```
É só multiplicar galera.
3(30%) x 9(90) = 27
E assim pra qualquer tipo de cálculo de %.
EX: 40% de 120? 4x12= 48
```
