# Calculus

> Calculus is the branch of mathematics that deals with the study of **"Rates of Change"** and **"Accumulation of Quantities"**.

It is divided into two main branches:

 - **Differential calculus: Deals with rates of change and finding the derivatives of functions**
   - **Limits and continuity:** Understanding how functions behave as their inputs approach certain values
   - **Differentiation:** Finding the derivative of a function, which represents its rate of change.
 - **Integral calculus: Deals with accumulation and finding the integrals of functions**
