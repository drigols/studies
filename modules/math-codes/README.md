## Arithmetic

> Arithmetic is the branch of mathematics that deals with the basic operations and properties of numbers, including *addition*, *subtraction*, *multiplication*, *division*, and their combinations. **It mainly focuses on direct numerical calculations and manipulation of concrete quantities**.

## Algebra

> Algebra is the branch of mathematics that uses **"symbols"** and **"letters"** to represent numbers and unknown quantities, **"called variables"**. It deals with equations, algebraic expressions, and relationships between quantities, allowing for the generalization of mathematical patterns and the solution of complex problems. Algebra studies abstract structures and the properties of operations on these structures.

## Linear Algebra

> **Linear algebra** is the branch of mathematics that **deals with "vector spaces"** and **"linear mappings"** between these spaces. It studies the properties of *"vectors"*, *"matrices"*, and *"systems of linear equations"*.

## Calculus

> Calculus is the branch of mathematics that deals with the study of **"rates of change"** and **"accumulation of quantities"**.

It is divided into two main branches:

 - **Differential calculus: Deals with rates of change and finding the derivatives of functions**
   - **Limits and continuity:** Understanding how functions behave as their inputs approach certain values
   - **Differentiation:** Finding the derivative of a function, which represents its rate of change.
 - **Integral calculus: Deals with accumulation and finding the integrals of functions**
