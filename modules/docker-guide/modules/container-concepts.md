## The container idea

> The idea of *containers* is to be **disposable**.

**NOTE:**  
If you use the same *container* for too long without **discarding** it, you're probably using Docker incorrectly. 

> <u>Containers is not a machine</u>, **it is a running process**.

And, like every process, it must be **discarded** so that another can take its place in the reboot of it.
