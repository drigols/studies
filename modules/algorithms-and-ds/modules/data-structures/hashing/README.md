## Intro to Hashing and Why do we need Hashing?

Hashing is the process of `mapping` **variable-sized data** to **fixed-size data** using a function called a *hash function*. 

> **What's "mapping variable-sized data to fixed-size data"?**

For example, consider a **set of strings as variable-sized data**:

```python
String 1: "apple"
String 2: "banana"
String 3: "orange"
```

> **NOTE:**  
> Each string can have a different length. That's, variable size.

Now, let's say we want to map these strings to fixed-size hash codes. A simple hash function might assign a numerical value to each character and sum them up:

```python
Hash("apple")   = 1 + 16 + 16 + 12 + 5   = 50
Hash("banana")  = 2 + 1 + 14 + 1 + 14 + 1  = 33
Hash("orange")  = 15 + 18 + 1 + 14 + 7 + 5 = 60
```

**NOTE:**  
Here, the **variable-sized strings "apple," "banana," and "orange"** are `mapped` to **fixed-size hash codes 50, 33, and 60**, respectively. 

> **Ok, but why do we need Hashing?**  
> The main ***Hashing*** focus is to **store** and **search** data fast.

For example, Array Data Structure:

 - Storing data in Array takes **O(1)** time.
 - Searching in it takes at least **O(log n)** time.

**NOTE:**  
This time appears to be small, but for a large data set, it can cause a lot of problems and this, in turn, makes the Array data structure inefficient. 

**Solution:**  
To solve that are looking for a data structure that can store the data and search in it in *constant time*, i.e. in *O(1) time*.

> This is how ***Hashing*** Data Structure came into play.

 - A ***Hash Table*** is a Data Structure that offers very fast *insertion* and *searching*.
 - No matter how many data items there are, *insertion* and *searching* (and sometimes deletion) can take close to *constant time*: **O(1)** in Big O notation.
 - Our main objective here is to search or update the values stored in the table quickly in **O(1)** time and we are not concerned about the ordering of strings in the table.

## Components of Hashing

There are majorly components of hashing:

 - **Key:**
   - In the context of hashing, a ***"key"*** refers to the input data provided to the *hash function* to generate a *hash value*.
 - **Hash Function:**
   - A ***hash function*** is nothing but a *mathematical algorithm* which helps generate a new value for a given input.
   - The ***Hash Function*** takes an *input (or "key")* and returns a *hash value*, which is typically an *integer*.
 - **Hash Table:**
   - ***Hash Table*** is a *container* to store the *key-value* pairs.

## How does Hashing work?

To understand how Hashing works imagine we have a set of strings and we would like to store it in a *Hash Table*:

```bash
{“ab”, “cd”, “efg”}
```

The next step is to pass the *set of strings (keys)* as input to the *Hash Function (which is some mathematical formula)*.

Here is common the **Hash Function** replaces all letters with numbers. For example:

```bash
a = 1
b = 2
c = 3

........ etc, to all alphabetical characters. 

z = 26
```

Now for each set of strings (key), we need to summation all replaced values to generate a new value:

```bash
“ab”  = 1 + 2 = 3 (new value)
“cd”  = 3 + 4 = 7 (new value)
“efg” = 5 + 6 + 7 = 18 (new value)
```

 - Now, imagine we have a **Hash Table of size 7** to store these strings (original values/keys).
 - And the Hash Function that is used here is:
   -  **The sum of the characters in key** `mod` **Hash Table size**.

For example:

```bash
“ab”  = 3 mod 7 = 3 (hash value)
“cd”  = 7 mod 7 = 0 (hash value)
“efg” = 18 mod 7 = 4 (hash value)
```

To understand more easily, see the image below:

 - The above technique enables us to calculate the location of a given string by using a simple *Hash Function* and rapidly find the value that is stored in that location.
 - Therefore the idea of hashing seems like a great way to store (key, value) pairs of the data in a table.

## Hashing collision problem

If we consider the above example, the ***Hash Function*** we used is the sum of the letters, but if we examined the *Hash Function* closely then the problem can be easily visualized that for different strings same hash value is begin generated by the *Hash Function*. 

For example:

```bash
“cd”  = 7 mod 7 = 0 (hash value)
“dc”  = 7 mod 7 = 0 (hash value)

“ab”  = 3 mod 7 = 3 (hash value)
“ba”  = 3 mod 7 = 3 (hash value)

“efg” = 18 mod 7 = 4 (hash value)
“gfe” = 18 mod 7 = 4 (hash value)
“feg” = 18 mod 7 = 4 (hash value)
```

> **NOTE:**  
> This is known as ***collision*** and it creates problem in *searching*, *insertion*, *deletion*, and *updating* of value.
