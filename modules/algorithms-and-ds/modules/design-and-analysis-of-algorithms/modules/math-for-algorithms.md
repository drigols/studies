## Intro to Logarithms

> **Logarithms are the opposite of exponentials.**

 - Just as *subtraction* is the opposite of *addiction*;
 - And *division* is the opposite of *multiplication*;
 - **Logarithms** is the *opposite* of **exponentials**.

> Technically speaking (tecnicamente falando), `log functions are the inverses of exponential functions`.

For example, see the image below to understand more easily:

> **NOTE:**  
> We read the formula above as **"Log of x in base b", log<sub>b</sub>(x)**.
