## Why is this useful?

> It is very important to use multiple **Evaluation Metrics** to evaluate your *model*.

 - This is because a *model* can perform well using one **Evaluation Metric**;
 - But perform poorly using another **Evaluation Metric**.

> Using **Evaluation Metrics** is critical to ensuring that your model is operating correctly and optimally.
