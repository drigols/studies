## Liquidity

> The term **"Liquidity"** is related to the speed and ease with which you can redeem (recover) the money from an investment.

 - The **higher** the liquidity, *the faster and easier the redemption (recovering)*.
 - The **lower** the liquidity, *the slower and more difficult the redemption (recovering)*.

For example, see the chart below to understand the relationship between the **"Liquidity"** and the redemption (recovering) speed:

 - **X-axis:** Liquidity (Liquidez).
 - **Y-axis:** Redemption Ease (Facilidade de Resgate).
