## Mandatory (Obrigatoriedade) & Cardinality

Before starting with database cardinality, let's understand some concepts. First, see the image below:

![img](images/card-01.png)  

See that:

 - **The first trace:**
   - Always represent the "mandatory".
 - **the second trace:**
   - Always represent the "cardinality".

For example, see the image below to understand more easily:

![img](images/trace-approach-names.png)  

**NOTE:**  
See we have different **mandatory** and **cardinality**. For example, the tables **users** and **profiles**:

![img](images/users-profiles.png)  

> **NOTE:**  
> **users** and **profiles** have different <u>mandatory</u>:
> - **users** table <u>mandatory</u> need minimum one (1) user.
> - **profiles** table <u>no mandatory</u> need minimum one (can be zero | 0) profile.

There a numeric approach to represent that **mandatory** and **cardinality**:

**NOTE:**  
See we have the same representation, however, using numbers.

## Reading relationship cardinality

To read **relationship cardinality** between tables first we <u>ignore mandatory in the tables</u> and <u>only focus in tables cardinalities</u>.

For example, see the **relationship cardinality** between **Employee** and **Departament** tables:

![img](images/cardinality-ex01.jpg)

Ignoring mandatory in the tables, we have:

 - **The Employee can work (relationship) for many departments:**
   - one-to-many.
 - **Many Departments can have (relationship) one Employee:**
   - many-to-one

## One to One

A relationship between a **husband** and **wife** can be considered as <u>one to one</u>, where:

 - The <u>entities</u> are **Husband** and **Wife**.
 - And the <u>relationship</u> is **Marriage**.

> **NOTE:**  
> This means, if you put this information in a DBMS table, a particular row of one table only associates itself with single and unique row of another table.

For example, see the image below to understand more easily:

## One to Many

A relationship between a **Company (1)** and **Employees (n)** can be considered as <u>one to many</u>, where:

 - The <u>entities</u> are **company** and **employees**.
 - And the <u>relationship</u> is **pays**.

> **NOTE:**  
> This means, if you put this information in a DBMS table, a particular row of one table associates itself with multiple rows of another table.

For example, see the image below to understand more easily:

![img](images/one-to-many.png)

<div id="many-to-one"></div>

## Many to One

A relationship between a **Students** and **University** can be considered as <u>many to one</u>, where:

 - The <u>entities</u> are **Students** and **University**.
 - And the <u>relationship</u> is study.

> **NOTE:**  
> This means, if you put this information in a DBMS table, multiple rows of student table associates itselves with single row of University table.

For example, see the image below to understand more easily:

![img](images/many-to-one.png)

<div id="many-to-many"></div>

## Many to Many

A relationship between a **students** and **courses** can be considered as <u>many to many</u>, where:

 - The <u>entities</u> are **students** and **courses**.
 - And the <u>relationship</u> is enroll.

> **NOTE:**  
> This means, if you put this information in a DBMS table, a multiple rows of one table associates itself with multiple rows of another table.

For example, see the image below to understand more easily:

## How to read the relationships

 - **One-to-One (1:1)**
   - 1 registro de uma tabela se relaciona com outro (1) registro em outra tabela.
 - **One-to-Many (1:M)**
   - 1 registro de uma tabela se relaciona com v√°rios registros de outra tabela.
 - **Many-to-Many (M:N)**
   - Muitos registros de uma tabela se relacionam com muitos registros de outra tabela.
