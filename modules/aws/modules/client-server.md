## Introduction to Client-Server Model

 - In computing, a **client** can be a web browser or desktop application that a person interacts with to make requests to computer servers.
 - A **server** can be services such as Amazon *Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)*, a type of virtual server.

For example, suppose that a client makes a request for a news article, the score in an online game, or a funny video. The server evaluates the details of this request and fulfills it by returning the information to the client.
