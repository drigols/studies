## Compilation

**Compilation** in the strict meaning denotes the process:

 - Translating the code of a *higher-level language*.
 - To the code of a *lower-level language* (typically, assembler or even machine code) production files.

**NOTE:**  
 - If the compilation is performed on one *platform (CPU/OS)* to produce code to be run on some other *platform (CPU/OS)*, it is called **cross-compilation**.
 - The usual practice is to use some of the desktop OS (Linux, Windows) to generate the code for embedded or mobile devices.

## Decompilation (disassembling)

**Decompilation (disassembling)** is the process:

 - Converting the source code of a *lower-level language*;
 - To the *higher-level language*.
 - That's, compilation inverse.
