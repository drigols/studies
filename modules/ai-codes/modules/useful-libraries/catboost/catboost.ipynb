    " - Gradient boosted trees is a type of gradient booting machines algorithm where all estimators of ensemble are decision trees.\n",
    " - It combines predictions of these weak tree learners to predict final output.\n",

    "**NOTE:**  \n",
    "It can be used **Catboost** for *classification*, *regression*, *ranking*, and other machine learning tasks.\n"

    "\n",
    " - Catboost provided support for handling **categorical** and **text features** of the data without the developer needing to handle them separately.\n",
    " - Catboost also provides support for **grid search** and **randomized search** which lets us try out a list of values for parameters to find the best combination of parameters that gives the best results.\n",
    " - Catboost algorithm gives quite a **good accuracy** with default parameter settings.\n",
    " - Apart from this, catboost also provides support for running the training process on **GPU**. It even lets us run the training process on multiple GPUs with simple configurations.\n",
    " - Finally, Catboost provides API in **Python** and **R**."

    "   - **get_cat_feature_indices()** - It returns list of indices which has categorical features.\n",
    "   - **get_feature_importance()** - It returns feature importance of individual feature according to trained model.\n",
    "   - **shrink(ntree_end, ntree_start=0)** - It accepts two arguments which are end tree and starts tree to shrink ensemble to include only trees that come in that index range discarding all other trees.\n",
    "   - **set_params()** - It can be used to set parameters of the estimator. Please make a note that this method will only work before the training model.\n",
    "   - **calc_leaf_indexes(data, ntree_start=0,ntree_end=0)** - It takes as input data and returns index of leaf in each tree which was used to make prediction for sample. The output of this function will be n_samples x n_trees. It'll return all trees' leaf index for a sample.\n",
    "   - **get_leaf_values()** - It returns actual leaf values of the trees in ensemble.\n",

In order to do a grid search, we need to create an estimator without setting parameters that we want to try.

    "   - **param_grid** - It accepts a dictionary of parameter names and a list of values to try for that parameters.\n",

    "   - **y** - It accepts target labels of data. If we are using the catboost.Pool data structure which has labels info then we don't need to pass this parameter value.\n",
    "   - **cv** - It accepts integer or sklearn data splitter classes (KFold, StratifiedKFold, ShuffleSplit, StratifiedShuffleSplit). If we give an integer as input then that many folds of data will be created for training. The default value of the parameter is 3.\n",
    "   - **calc_cv_statistics** - It accepts boolean value specifying whether to calculate cross-validation statistics. The default is True.\n",
    "   - **refit** - It accepts boolean values specifying whether to train a model using the best parameter setting found using cross-validation. The default is True.\n",
