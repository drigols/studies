## 01 - The Chain Rule

In calculus, the Chain Rule is a formula for the derivative of the function composed of two functions.

Okay, let's go to the examples, suppose we have the following functions:

See that we now have 2 functions **y** and **z**, where:

 - **y** depends on **z**;
 - And **z** depends on **x**.

Now I want to Derive my **y** function for **x**:

Hey, how will it be? If my **y** depends on **z** and my **z** depends on **x**?

**THE CHAIN ​​RULE:**  
This is where the concept of **the Chain Rule** comes in. Just follow the formula below:

Now just take the Derivative from **y** to **z**; and from **z** to **x**; and then multiply them... It will look like this:

**NOTE:**  
It is important to remember that some of these variables are related to another, for example, my **z = 3x**, so we changed that when working out the equation.

But in the end what matters is that the Derivative of the function y with respect to **x** is **18x**.
